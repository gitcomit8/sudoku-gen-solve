Sudoku Solver and Generator: Java and Assembly Implementations
==============================================================

Overview

This repository presents two distinct implementations for solving and generating Sudoku puzzles: a Java version and an Assembly version. Both implementations leverage fundamental algorithmic techniques like backtracking and constraint propagation to efficiently tackle Sudoku challenges.

Features

### Common Features

-   Sudoku Solver:
    -   Efficiently solves Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels.
    -   Utilizes backtracking and constraint propagation algorithms.
    -   Can handle both partially filled and completely empty grids.
-   Sudoku Generator:
    -   Generates new Sudoku puzzles of different difficulty levels.
    -   Employs a technique of solving a puzzle and then removing cells to create a solvable puzzle.
    -   Ensures generated puzzles have unique solutions.

### Language-Specific Features

-   Java Implementation:
    -   Leverages Java's object-oriented paradigm for modular and maintainable code.
    -   Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting puzzles and visualizing the solving process.
-   Assembly Implementation:
    -   Demonstrates low-level control and optimization techniques.
    -   Offers insights into the core algorithms and data structures involved.

Getting Started

1.  Clone the Repository:

    Bash

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sudoku-solver-generator.git

    ```

2.  Set Up Environment:
    -   Java: Ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
    -   Assembly: Install an appropriate assembler and linker for your target architecture (e.g., NASM, GCC).
3.  Build and Run:
    -   Java:

        Bash

        ```
        javac Solver.java Generator.java
        java Solver
        java Generator

        ```

    -   Assembly:

        Bash

        ```
        nasm -f elf64 solver.asm
        ld solver.o -o solver
        ./solver
        # Similar steps for the generator

        ```

Implementation Details

### Common Algorithms

-   Backtracking: Explores different possibilities by making a choice, checking its validity, and backtracking if it leads to a dead end.
-   Constraint Propagation: Reduces the search space by eliminating impossible values for cells based on existing constraints.

### Language-Specific Implementations

-   Java:
    -   Utilizes Java's standard libraries for data structures and algorithms.
    -   Leverages object-oriented principles to model Sudoku grids and solving strategies.
-   Assembly:
    -   Directly manipulates memory and registers to implement the algorithms.
    -   Optimizes performance through careful instruction selection and memory access patterns.

Potential Improvements

-   Performance Optimization: Explore techniques like caching, pruning, and parallel processing.
-   Difficulty Level Calibration: Fine-tune the difficulty level generation algorithm for more precise control.
-   User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for inputting puzzles and visualizing the solving process (Java).
-   Puzzle Analysis: Implement features to analyze puzzle statistics and identify patterns.
-   Assembly Optimization: Further optimize the Assembly code by leveraging assembly-specific techniques and hardware features.
